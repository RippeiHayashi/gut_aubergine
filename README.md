# gut_aubergine
Code and data repository for the study of the PIWI gene aubergine in the fly gut

### 122_dmel_TE_Senti2015.fa
122 transposon sequences from D. melanogaster used in this study.
It was originally annotated in Senti 2015 (PMID: 26302790)

### gut_sRNAseq_analysis.sh
The code was used to analyse the small RNA sequencing data for gut and ovary samples from Drosophila melanogaster.

### gut_RNAseq_analysis.sh
The code was used to analyse the poly-A selected RNA sequencing data from fly guts.

### gut_TE-piRNAs_size_distribution_endo-siRNA-normalised.R
The code was used to analyse the size distribution and nucleotide composition of TE mapping small RNA reads normalised to endo-siRNAs abundance (see also gut_sRNAseq_analysis.sh).

### gut_piRNAs-genomic-tile-analysis.R
The code was used to make scatter plots of piRNA genomic tile coverage and the table that summarises data from all libraries (see also gut_sRNAseq_analysis.sh).

### gut_TE-mRNAs.R
The code was used to make scatter plots of TE mRNA counts using the outputs of salmon mapping (see also gut_RNAseq_analysis.sh).
